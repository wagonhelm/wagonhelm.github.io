Wowzas, what a journey, I did it, what's next? Is what comes to mind reflecting on the last six years of my life where I left my Vancouver Island floating home to return to my birth province of Alberta to persure a Bachelor of Science in computing science. Thanks to folks like Rich Sutton and Jonathon Schaeffer I certainly would not be here reflecting on this.

So what's next? First I'm hoping to travel to Nepal and hike the Himalayas with my trusty camping hammock and hopefully a pack Yak. After that, not really sure... Guess I'll see how things unfold.
